# Unofficial TensorDock Python SDK

This is an unofficial Python SDK for interacting with the TensorDock Marketplace API. It provides a convenient way to manage virtual machines, containers, and billing information programmatically. Please note that this SDK is not officially supported or endorsed by TensorDock.

## Installation

You can install this unofficial TensorDock Python SDK using pip:

```
pip install unofficial-tensordock-python-sdk
```

## Configuration

To use the SDK, you'll need to obtain an API key and token from the TensorDock marketplace. You can get these from your TensorDock dashboard at https://marketplace.tensordock.com/api

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the SDK:

```python
from unofficial_tensordock import TensorDockAPI

# Initialize the API client
api = TensorDockAPI(api_key='your_api_key', api_token='your_api_token')

# List your virtual machines
vms = api.virtual_machines.list_vms()
print(vms)

# Deploy a new virtual machine
new_vm = api.virtual_machines.deploy_vm(
    name="My New VM",
    gpu_count=1,
    gpu_model="rtx3080-pcie-10gb",
    vcpus=4,
    ram=16,
    storage=100,
    operating_system="Ubuntu 20.04 LTS"
)
print(new_vm)
```
